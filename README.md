## About

As an introduction to operating systems, students were tasked with implementing simplified versions of the core concepts covered throughout the course. The project uses [xv6](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2012/xv6.html), a bare bones operating system designed to communicate essential concepts and architecture one would find within the Linux and Unix systems.
